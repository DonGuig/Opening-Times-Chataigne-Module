# Opening Times module for Chataigne

For all the days of the week, you can set opening and closing times.

When opening, the Opening Trigger in the values container will be triggered. For closing, it is the Closing Trigger.

You can request that the closing happens after midnight, with for example opening times from 09:00 to 01:00. The system will adapt and trigger the closing at 01:00 the next day (e.g. tuesday if you are inputing the values for monday).

You can also add exceptions : at a given date, other opening and closing times will be used.
